# World_Population_1970-2022_EDA

The project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about world populations. The main objectives of the analysis were to gain insights into the data distribution, identify trends, and prepare the data for further analysis.

# Data Source

The dataset used in this project contains world population data from 1970 to 2022. The dataset is available at Kaggle.

# Technologies Used

  - Python
    
  - Pandas

  - Matplotlib
    
  - Seaborn

# Exploratory Data Analysis

  1. Explored the **datatype** of each column in the dataset to understand the nature of the data.

  2. Calculated and analyzed the **range (min, max), and mean** of numerical columns to understand the distribution of values.
  
  3. Identified and assessed the presence of **null values** in the dataset for the data cleaning process.
  
  4. Discovered **unique** countries and regions within the dataset.

  5. Investigated the **correlation** between variables and visualized the correlation matrix using a **HeatMap**. This helped to identify relationships between different features.
  
  6. Used the GroupBy operation to aggregate data by continents and **visualized population trends** across continents using a Bar Chart.
     
  7. Plotted a Boxplot to **identify outliers** in the dataset.
